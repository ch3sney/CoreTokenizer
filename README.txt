Hello!

Running my tokenizer should be relatively simple. As the project description mentions, the path to the
Core code should be passed as the first argument in the main method.

The only other important note is that enabling assertions is required for using my intVal and idName
methods.

Let me know if any other issues arise when grading my project. Thanks!
